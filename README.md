# Introduction
```
This SQL project analyzes a coffee sales dataset for a company named ”Monday
Coffee” to derive insights about customer behavior, product performance, and
market potential across various cities. The dataset includes information about
cities, products, customers, and sales transactions. The project encompasses
exploratory data analysis (EDA) and ten analytical queries to address specific
business requirements, ranging from estimating coffee consumer populations
to identifying high-potential markets. The goal is to provide actionable insights
for business expansion and optimization strategies.
The objectives are to:
• Understand the dataset structure and relationships between tables.
• Perform EDA to inspect the data and ensure its integrity.
• Answer business questions through SQL queries, covering sales performance,
customer segmentation, and market analysis.
• Provide recommendations based on the analysis for targeting high-potential
cities.
